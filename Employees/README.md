## Summary
* From 1990 to 2002, the employees of the company have consistently been around 60% male and aroudn 40% female.
* The number of managers per department increased quickly from 1990 to 1996. Then, the number began to plateau and decrease. The decrease after 1998 makes sense because because there was a recession in the early 2000s.
* There were significantly fewer female managers per department in 1990 and 1991. The number started to become more equal in 1992 with 11 female managers and 18 male managers. 
* Although the difference isn't as large as it was in 1990, there are still more male managers than female. This could just be beceause there are more male employees.
* Average annual salary has steadily increased over time.
* The average salary of male and female employees per department since 1990 has been very similar. The biggest difference is about $1,000, which isn't really a significant amount.
