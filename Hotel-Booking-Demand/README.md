## Bookings
* August had the most bookings (13,877).
* After August, the number of bookings started a downward trend to December.
* November and December had a similar amount of bookings (both around 6,700).
* Although August had the most bookings, it did not have the highest average waiting time. Rather, the opposite. Despite having a large amount of bookings, July and August had the lowest average waiting times.
* July and September had similar average lead times (around 136 days), which means guests booked their rooms for July and September on average 136 days in advance.
* Unsurprisingly, the most popular arrival month, August, had the highest average daily rate (140.11).

## Age Demographic
* August, which has the highest amount of bookings, also had the highest average number of adults, children, and babies per reservation. July was a close second.
* This may be because children are on summer break in July and August, which could also explain why these months have more bookings.
