# # Hubway Database Exploratory Analysis

# Database from the bike-sharing service Hubway (data on over 1.5 million trips made with the service). Used Python to run SQL code to make it easier to display results on Jupyter Notebook. 

# ## Import Hubway database

import sqlite3
import pandas as pd
db = sqlite3.connect('hubway.db')
