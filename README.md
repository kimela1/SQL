### Employees Database Analysis
Used SQL and Tableau to create visualizations from a relational database that contains information about the employees of a company between 1990 to 2002. Broke this down into 4 subproblems: <br>
1. Provide a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990.
2. Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.
3. Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.
4. Obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range.

* Created table in MySQL to import data from CSV to MySQL
* Cleaned data in SQL to begin analysis
* Exploratory data analysis: When is the busiest time for hotels? When should I book a hotel room if I want to avoid the crowd? Exploring these questions and drawing conclusions from the data.
* Recommendations: What recommendations can be given based on the analysis made with this data?
