## Summary
* From 1990 to 2002, the employees of the company have consistently been around 60% male and aroudn 40% female.
* The number of managers per department increased quickly from 1990 to 1996. Then, the number began to plateau and decrease. The decrease after 1998 makes sense because because there was a recession in the early 2000s.
* There is a higher number of male managers per department. This could just be because there are more male employees.
* Average annual salary has steadily increased over time.
* The average salary of male and female employees per department since 1990 has been very similar. The biggest difference is about $1,000, which isn't really a significant amount.
