# SQL

### Employee Database Data Exploration
Used SQL and Tableau to create visualizations from a relational database that contains information about the employees of a company between 1990 to 2002. Broke this down into 4 subproblems: <br>
1. Provide a breakdown between the male and female employees working in the company each year, starting from 1990. Visualization: bar chart
2. Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990. Visualization: area chart
3. Compare the average salary of female versus male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department. Visualization: line chart
4. Obtain the average male and female salary per department within a certain salary range. Visualization: double bar chart
